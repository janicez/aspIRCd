##aspIRCd 5.0.7 RC1
aspIRCd has jumped to the next level, 5.0.7-RC1 (Release Candidate) \/
**NOTE**: This is a Release Candidate, you may or may not spot bugs. If you do, report it to us at our Developmental Server.
- Upon realising, that aspIRCd didn't have got mbedTLS , we have finally added support for mbedTLS in aspIRCd (The most secured TLS base).
- Updated sqlite to sqlite3.12.0 for better functioning and to prevent memory leaks.
- **cap-notify** : fixed possible crashes on 64-bit systems.
- Removed **RB_PRNG_EGD** to limit down crashes and it wasn't used and/or needed by any users.
- **src/channel** : added support for IRCv3.2 userhost-in-names.
- Reinitialised and removed **away-notify** , as it wasn't needed.
- **m_kill**: No longer notify public users the OPER that killed the user.
- Added support for usermode +W and displays swhois "is using a Web-Based client." as a usermode.
- Finally fixed the swhois compile error.
- SCTP now functions properly.

##aspIRCd 5.0.6
The aspIRCd 5.0.6-RC1 brings you a variety of features as listed below:
**NOTE:** This is a Release Candidate-1 for aspIRCd's 5.0.6 version. You may report any bugs , if found (any). either /at our Development Server or /at our GitHub by opening a new Issue.
- Added TLS capability for SSL connections. We are using IRCv3.1 TLS this time.
- For the same, we had to add m_starttls module which is added in the initial Makefile, it will compile.
- For this update, we are keeping mbedTLS, as it is arm based iirc and our starttls module (IRCv3.1 TLS) will depend upon it to run in background.
- We added the command /dehelper for IRC Operators who don't have much time to run `/mode (nick) -h` to disappear in /stats p , probabaly when they are going away, the /dehelper command extends to modding your and as well as some other person's nick **-h** to disappear as helpop.
- Fixed a small bug, in messages.tab corrected it from `/msg ChanServ help mlock` to `/msg ChanServ help set mlock` 
- added all new SASL authentication, which features upto the features of IRCv3.2 SASL.
- We **haven't** updated IRCv3.2's chghost , so you may find it to be obslete at the moment. We will get it worth to you next update.
- Fixed **stringops.h** `include/inline/stringops.h` as it could not print the string on high bit bytes, as the script as from initial was coded so as to break, whenever high bit bytes were supplied.
- With all new SASL, we have fixed the compile error on Debian 8 , which extends to new features and extendability.
