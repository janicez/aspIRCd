## aspIRCd

**aspIRCd** is a high performance, IRCv3.2 capable, and scalable
IRC daemon. It is a fork of the now-defunct ircd-seven and seeks to continue in
the direction ircd-seven was headed.

## Main differences between this release and depreciated Charybdis 4:
- It has +q (owner mode) , +a (admin mode) and the general +Ohv modes which Charybdis already contains. Due to this we had to shift the quiet mode to +y
- It is headed in the direction of UnrealIRCd and hence a lot of features on the Charybdis platform.
- It has one more major feature +h which IRC Operators set to declare themselves as helpops and show an swhois ‘is available for help.’ in their /whois
- It has in built support for mbedTLS which is automatically selected on ARM based servers
- It has support for Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) for connection and linking servers
- It has support for starttls and TLS v1.3 (most secured TLS base in the IRC industry)

## Supported Platforms

All modern \*NIX systems should work. You need the equivalent of the following
Debian packages:

 - `libssl-dev`
 - `flex`
 - `bison`
 - `build-essential`
 - `libsqlite3-dev`
 - `libtool`
 - `autoconf`
 
 You however have a choice of choosing any of your favourite SSL supporting applications. One of them, we primarily support is one of that of OpenSSL.
 To make sure SSL ports works, issue a certificate to your IRC Network by going in the `main directory@/bin` and running:
 `./genssl.sh`
