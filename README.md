## aspIRCd

**aspIRCd** is a high performance, lightweight, and scalable
IRC daemon. It is a fork of the now-defunct ircd-seven and seeks to continue in
the direction ircd-seven was headed.

## Supported Platforms

All modern \*NIX systems should work. You need the equivalent of the following
Debian packages:

 - `libssl-dev`
 - `flex`
 - `bison`
 - `build-essential`
 - `libsqlite3-dev`
 - `libtool`
 - `autoconf`
 
 You however have a choice of choosing any of your favourite SSL supporting applications. One of them, we primarily support is one of that of OpenSSL.
 To make sure SSL ports works, issue a certificate to your IRC Network by going in the `main directory@/bin` and running:
 `./genssl.sh`

## Debian/ubuntu Users

If you have a newly installed OS, you should primarily run `apt-get update` followed by `apt-get install libssl-dev flex bison build-essential libsqlite3-dev pkg-config autoconf openssl libtool`

Read the included documentation for detailed compilation and install
directions.
